    <h1>Intro to flexbox</h1>
    <p>
      Flexbox is a layout system in CSS. It consists of a wrapper container called a "flex container".
      The children of this flex container are the elements you want to "lay out". They are called "flex items".
    </p>
    <p>
      Different properties are used for the flex container and for the flex items. For more predictable behaviour,
      do not set flex item properties on a flex container and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example the below example is using divs just to demo the properties but you can use any element 
      as the flex container (e.g. section) and any element as a flex item (e.g. if building a page layout, 
      main could be a flex item).
    </p>
    <!-- I like to use a class for setting something as a flex container so that it's reusable (you'd probably
         use flex more than once in a page). If you are using flex for a horizontal layout you may want to 
         give it a name to differentiate by giving a descriptive class name. Note that the class name is
         arbitrary but since I want to be able to reuse the class, I've indicated that the container is
         for a row (horizontal) layout. In most cases, you'd probably be using flexbox for horizontal
         layouts. -->
    <p>
      In most cases, horizontal layouts are the most complicated
      and you'd want the vertical layout to grow according to 
      content length so I use the row layout in the majority of
      cases.

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
      <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
      <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
      <div class="flex-item">Some content</div>
      <div class="flex-item">Even more content</div>
    </div>
