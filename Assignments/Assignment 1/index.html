            <h2>Ghost of Tsushima</h2>
            <p>
                This is an absolutely gorgeous open-world game developed by 
                <i>Sucker Punch Productions</i>. The game tells the story of Jin Sakai,
                who is trying to fight off the Mongol Invasion in the island of Tsushima
                to save his people from Mongol rule. I really loved how you can 
                explore the beautiful sceneries of feudal Japan. The gameplay is absolutely
                breathtaking. Throughout the game, we could see Jin's inner struggle where 
                he has the choice to fight with honor or use the invader's tactics to get rid of them.
                The fight sequences are also well choreographed. It makes us feel like we are 
                actually fighting in the invasion.

            <h2>The Last of Us Part I</h2>
            <p>
                This game tells the story of how there was an outbreak of a deadly virus and 
                how people are being forced to survive in those extreme circumstances. 
                Joel, who lost his family during the chaos of the outbreak and Ellie, who 
                has some secrets up her sleeve, are being forced to go on a journey through the 
                pandemic-hit world with a special mission. We are introduced to various kinds of
                'infected' beings and how humans struggle to survive in that world. The story is well written
                and the game mechanics gives us the horror-adventure vibe we were all looking for.

            <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
            <p>
                Set during the early 20th century, the story follows Arthur Morgan, an outlaw
                who was trying to survive in the world by whatever means neccessary.
                The game makes us get involved into a lot of looting and heists setup by 
                Dutch van der Linde, who is the leader of the camp. During the start of the game,
                the gang is on a run after a heist gone wrong. The game really makes us explore
                a lot and progress furthur into the story in our own pace. As the game progresses,
                you can control the 'honor meter' of Arthur Morgan by doing good/bad deeds. 
                With strong writing and direction, the game really lets you explore what it really
                means to be a hero and take care of your loved ones.
